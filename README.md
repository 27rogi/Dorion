# Setup

Download a [release](https://github.com/SpikeHD/Dorion/releases) (`.msi` for Windows 10/11, ~~`.zip` for Windows 7~~, `.deb` for Linux, etc.) and install!

# Benefits

* Portable (mostly)
* Plugins
* Themes
  * Including support for BetterDiscord themes!
* Low - if any - cache footprint (compared to [the PTB client](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25207995/189549033-b372ca74-5f30-4864-b71a-10a88405537a.png))
* Extremely small installation size (~10mb!) on Windows
  * This is because unlike the Discord client, Dorion does *not* bundle an entire Chromium engine
* Often loads slightly faster (vanilla)
* Switch between Stable, Canary and PTB clients straight from the settings
* Made by me (automatically makes it cooler)

I know I made the program 'n all, but I actually use this on my laptop as opposed to the official client, so I can vouch ðŸ˜Ž

# Limitations

Dorion simply runs the web-based version of Discord within it's own client. This means that things Discord web doesn't support will not work. I am unaware of any significant feature that is missing.

# Known Issues

* Drag 'n Drop ([#3](https://github.com/SpikeHD/Dorion/issues/3))
* A couple bugs with CSS & image importt related stuff

# TODO

* Desktop notifications
  * AND displaying the number of notifs in the desktop icon
* Rich presence(?)
* Helper API methods and events for plugins
* Backup localized themes
* Minimize to tray

# Using Plugins and Themes

*See the `examples` directory for examples of plugins, including how to include external code, and themes. You can also look at [my own plugins/themes repo](https://github.com/SpikeHD/DorionPluginsAndThemes) for some existing ones with actual use.*

Plugins and themes are relatively simple to use, the file structure looks like so on Windows:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ C:/Users/USERNAME/dorion
    â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/
    |   â””â”€â”€ plugin_name/
    |       â””â”€â”€ index.js
    â””â”€â”€ themes/
        â””â”€â”€ theme.css
        â””â”€â”€ Theme2
            â””â”€â”€ theme2.css
```

and like so on Linux:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ ~/dorion
    â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/
    |   â””â”€â”€ plugin_name/
    |       â””â”€â”€ index.js
    â””â”€â”€ themes/
        â””â”€â”€ theme.css
        â””â”€â”€ Theme2
            â””â”€â”€ theme2.css
```

so if you download a plugin or theme, just pop it into it's own folder in the `plugins`/`themes` folder!
