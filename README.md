# Setup

Download a [release](https://github.com/SpikeHD/Dorion/releases) (`.msi` for Windows 10/11, `.zip` for Windows 7, `.AppImage` for Linux, etc.) and install!

# Benefits

* Portable (mostly)
* Plugins
* Themes
* Extremely small installation size (~7mb!)
  * This is because unlike the Discord client, Dorion does *not* bundle an entire Chromium engine
* Often loads slightly faster
* Made by me (automatically makes it cooler)

I know I made the program 'n all, but I actually use this on my laptop as opposed to the official client, so I can vouch ðŸ˜Ž

# Limitations

Dorion simply runs the web-based version of Discord within it's own client. This means that things Discord web doesn't support, like screen sharing (which is stupid, because Google Meets supports it), will not work.

# Using Plugins and Themes

*See the `examples` directory for examples of plugins and themes*

Plugins and themes are relatively simple to use, the file structure looks like so:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ /path/to/Dorion/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Dorion.exe or whatever
    â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/
    |   â””â”€â”€ plugin_name/
    |       â””â”€â”€ index.js
    â””â”€â”€ themes/
        â””â”€â”€ theme_name/
            â””â”€â”€ index.css
```

so if you download a plugin or theme, just pop it into it's own folder in the `plugins`/`themes` folder!
